## Voicemod API

### Configuration
Due to a limitation in the voicemod software, host address should always be 127.0.0.1. 
It was stated in their issue tracker that they will be looking at adding a toggle to 
allow connections from outside the local host.

This would benefit users that want to run voicemod on another system from the controlling software.
