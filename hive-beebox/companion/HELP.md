## Hive Beebox / Beeblade Module

This module provides conntrol for the Hive Beeblade range of media engine products. It should also work for all derivatives of the Beeblade such as Beebox, Beehive, Nucleus and to some extent older legacy models such as Player_1, Player_2, Player_3 and Player_4 although functionality on these devices may be limited.

For this module to work, the target device must be setup on the network and you will require it's IP address so that a communication channel can be established.

Please note that this module will only control a single device per instance even if the device s setup as a queen, so if you have workers they need to be setup seperately (except for parameter changes which are populated automaticaly by the queen)
