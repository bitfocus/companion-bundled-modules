# Media Control Bridge

This module connects to [Media Control Bridge](https://github.com/tomhillmeyer/media-control-bridge) that runs on macOS or Windows and bridges the OS-level media controls and information into a basic HTTP API and WebSockets. That means this module has play, pause, forward, and back media control actions and song title, artist, album, and album art as variables and feedback.
