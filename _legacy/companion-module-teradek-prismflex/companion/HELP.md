Teradek Prism Flex

## This module works specifically with the Teradek Prism Flex model. It may not work with the original rack mounted Prism, and has not been tested on other models at this time.

## Actions

It is recommended to use the presets as much as possible as there are a lot of actions, variables, and feedbacks that work together.

The actions are separated into the following categories:

**Recording**

- Start/Stop

**Setting Fie Name**

- File name for next recording

**Record With Name**
*This action sets the fie name and triggers record*

-File name for this recording

**Setting Stream Info**
*Settings currently only work for RTMP mode*

- Stream Name
- Username
- Password
- Stream URL
- Stream Key

**Streaming**

*Depending on your streaming platform, you may need to determine which of these actions will control your stream. The default is Publish/Unpublish.*

- Publish
- Unpublish
- Broadcast
- Halt
- Cancel
- Preview
- End Preview
