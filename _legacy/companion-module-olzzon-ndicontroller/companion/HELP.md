## NDI Controller

**Available commands**

- Set Crosspoint

**Available Status**

- Source labels
- Source selected status

**Example :**
In the repo, there's an example file, "Olzzon-NDI-example.companionconfig" that you can import into your companion.

Basically you need to add following to a button:
* Action (to set cross points) - source and target
* Variable (to reflect the NDI source label)
* Feedback (to reflect is the source is selected)
