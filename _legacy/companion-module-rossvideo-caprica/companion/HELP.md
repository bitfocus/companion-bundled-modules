# Ross Video Caprica

This Module connects to Ross Videos Caprica Server

In order to accept commands from Companion the Server must be configured as follows:
* In Dashboard -> Caprica -> Port Configuration
* Select a Remote Port
* Select RossTalk Device
* Select RossTalk-IN
* The Defaults should be sufficient but double check Role is set to Server
* Change the Port if neccessary. This needs to be the same as configured in the Companion Instance

## Available Actions
* Fire Custom Control

Caprica RossTalk-IN does not accept all the same commands as most RossTalk Devices.
Functionality is quite limited and not well documented.
