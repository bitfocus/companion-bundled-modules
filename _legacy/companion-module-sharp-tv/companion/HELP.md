## Sharp TV

This module will connect to a Sharp TV, it was build around a PN-LE901, but should work with most Sharp TV's/monitors with a network connection.

**Note:**

The "Network Card ON" action needs to be sent to the TV at least once while the tv is turned on, to enable power on/off functionality.
And for any tv to work with this module, you will need to disable all energy-saving features on the TV, as these disables communication via IP and serial connections.

Also, the manual has these notes:
* Configure settings required for connection to a network in
“System Setting” – “Ethernet” on the CONTENT MENU
screen of APPLICATION mode.
* When POWER SAVE MODE is set to ON, the control is
disabled in the standby mode.
* To control the monitor via LAN, set RS-232C/LAN SELECT
to LAN. Set “Telnet Server” to “ON” on “Setup” in APPLICATION
mode.
