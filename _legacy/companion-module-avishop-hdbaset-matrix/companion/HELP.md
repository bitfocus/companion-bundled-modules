**Some Notes**
* When you can only stack a max of 6 actions to this device without using some kind of delay. Otherwise, it won't recognise the last commands. Take a look at the "Set input to all" presets for an example on how this can be done/worked around.
* Video/Audio formats, that affect 4K resolutions might not work, needs more testing.
