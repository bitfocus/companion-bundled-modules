## Tally-MA Wireless Tally Module

https://www.tally-ma.com

This module allows for a quicker setup of the Tally-MA Wireless Tally functions with Companion, also allowing it to act as server or bystander but still allowing to control basic setup and color settings.

If Companion is serving tally, you can use built-in Triggers or Variables to send tally info to your Tally-MA light.
If using the normal tally servers, bypass the Companion server on the Instance Setup to "other" and you can continue to change Led Modes and colors.

Auto tally IP detection is possible or also setting the IP address manually.
