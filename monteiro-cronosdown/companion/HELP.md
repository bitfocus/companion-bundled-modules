## CronosDown
On the control page, you will have the timer activations.
Start - Starts the countdown
Stop - Pauses the countdown
Reset - Resets the countdown
Set - Sets the values

On the display page, you will have the values ​​of your stopwatch on your buttons, with Hour, Minute and Second separately, or a button with all three together.

On the function page, you will have options to increase or decrease the values ​​of the countdowns, as well as increase or decrease the font size of the timer on the second monitor.

In the preset section, you will have information about your time list, and all of them will adjust as you add times to the list. This becomes dynamic; if you delete an item from the list, the buttons will adapt.

On the set page, you have values ​​already defined for use, but when you press them, you must also press the set button to be able to define them.
