## SnapAV-WattBox

This module will allow you to control the WattBox family of devices using companion.

### Configuration

- The WattBox must be powered on and connected to the same network as the computer that is running Companion.
- This module controls the WattBox through REST on port 80 or Telnet on port 23.
