### Setup

When first setting up a connection you will need to pair with the Caseta Smart Bridge. The module will attempt to discover available bridges on the network. You can select it from the dropdown in the configuration menu. If your bridge does not appear, and you know the IP address, you can enter the IP address manually. Once you click Save you will have 30 seconds to press the black pairing button on the back of the Smart Bridge device. The module will then complete the pairing and you will see the module is connected. Any supported devices found on the smart bridge will have actions made available for them.
