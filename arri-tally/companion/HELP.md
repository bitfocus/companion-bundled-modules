# Arri Amira and Alexa Tally

Red Tally will display in the viewfinder and tally LEDs. Green Tally will only display in the viewfinder.

## Configuration
Enter the IP address of the control port of the camera. The port can be changed from the default 40000 but it is unlikely that this is necessary.
