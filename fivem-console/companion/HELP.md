**Sponsor**<br />
This module, as with Companion, is free and open source, but if you'd like to support the continued development of this and my other modules (vMix, Google Sheets, Twitch, Discord, Voicemeeter, and more) tips will always be appreciated either on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/thedist) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thedist).

**FiveM Console Info**<br />
Currently there is limited presets available in this first version but it will be expanded on over time. Until these presets are more flushed out it is still entirely possible to just manually make buttons but added the `Send Command` action and sending that you wish (keeping in mind that commands in the Console do not need to start with a slash like they would if used in chat).
