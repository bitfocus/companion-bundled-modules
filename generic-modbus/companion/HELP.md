## Modbus Module

This module provides basic functionality to write and read relay states for devices with Modbus.
It was built for the [Waveshare 8-ch Ethernet Relay Module (B)](https://www.waveshare.com/modbus-poe-eth-relay-b.htm).
Small changes and extensions might be needed to achieve compatibility with other Modbus devices.
