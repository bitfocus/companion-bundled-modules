## Samsung Smart TV Control

### Configuration

When connecting for the first time, please make sure your TV is turned on, connected to your network (preferably via Ethernet). Enable Companion to connect by Settings > General > External Device Manager > Device Connect Manager > Access Notification is set to "**First Time Only**". If you set it to "Always Ask" you will be prompted every time Companion tries to connect to your TV (which can be very often!). Enter your TV's IP address in Companion and then click "Save" to begin the connection. This module will attempt to connect to the entered IP address and determine the MAC address of your TV. (If your TV is off during this step, you may need to enter the MAC address manually). If your MAC address can be determined your TV will show a pop-up prompting Bitfocus Companion to control your display. Choose **Allow** to let this module issue commands to your TV.

**Note:** Because your TV may remain off for large periods of time, make sure you are using a static IP address or have a DHCP reservation set for your TV, otherwise when reconnecting to your network it may assume a new address.
