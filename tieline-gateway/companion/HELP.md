## Configuration
Fill in the tieline ip-address, username and password. 
As of this moment the companion module uses the standard port 8080. 
Let me know if you need to use another port, then I'll implement the possibility to set a costum port.

## Functions in the module
The only action I have implemented right now is the possibility to change cross points in the matrix: "Set matrix routing". 
Doing this you can route any input to any output using the summing matrix of the tieline gateway. 

I havn't implemented any network og connection features, because I didn't dare doing it while we were broadcasting; as we were the whole of the olympics 2024. 

Let me know if you have any specific features you're missing, the I'll try and work on it, though my time is limited.
