## Resi Decoders

This module controls Resi DECODERS ONLY via RossTalk.

Please DO NOT use this module to attempt to control Resi Encoders.

Enter the IP address of the Decoder when setting up the instance.

**Available commands**

Some commands are considered to be in "Early Field Trials" by
Resi and must be enabled on your decoder by the support team.
The commands in the Companion instance, generally, will not
break anything if you try to use them when the features are
not enabled on your decoder, but please do not chance it as
there are no guarantees to how your system will respond to
an unknown command. Play and Pause are generally available
on all Resi decoders.

Presets are available for all commands. Currently, there are
no additional options necessary for the presets. Set up your instance,
drag a preset to a button and you are ready to go.

- Play
- Pause
- Fade From Black and Play
- Fade to Black and Pause
- Fade from Black
- Fade to Black

More commands will be added to this Companion module as they
are supported by Resi.

**Future Support**
It has been suggested that the following commands will be supported in the future.

- Seek Forward (by custom time)
- Seek Backward (by custom time)
