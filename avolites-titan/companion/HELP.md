# Controller for avolites titan desks
This module is made to control avolites titan lighting desks, to make sure all the commands work they always need to run the latest software version.
At this moment this is V14.0

The module will probably work with V12.1 too but the image feedback is only available from V14.0 onwards

WARNING
this module does NOT work with the titan one or T1, only T2, titan mobile or the physical desks.
this is because the module uses the avolites webapi which is not available on titan one or T1.
