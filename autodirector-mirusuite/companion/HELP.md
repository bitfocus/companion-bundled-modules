## MiruSuite Companion Module Help

This module is designed to control the [MiruSuite](https://mirusuite.de) software via Companion.

### Setup

1. Make sure MiruSuite is running and the Companion server has network access to the device running MiruSuite (port 8080).
2. Open the Companion web interface and add the MiruSuite module. Set the IP adress of the machine running MiruSuite in the configuration.
3. MiruSuite is now connected and you can start adding buttons. Try starting with the preconfigured presets!

If MiruSuite and the Companion server are running on the same device you should use `127.0.0.1` as the IP address.

### Usage
The MiruSuite Companion module offers different presets, actions, and feedbacks corresponding to the MiruSuite workflows. 

You can find explanations for all presets in the following table:
