Companion-module-sikn-kerkomroep

This module will check if a church with specified code is live at the moment.
Kerkomroep does not supply an API so this is reversed engineered.
The behaviour may change any moment unannounced.

There a two config items: 
-the id of the church (available in the url of the kerkomroep page of the church)
-the frequency to check the status of the stream, this is not yet implemented
