## ConferenceCaptioning

[ConferenceCaptioning](https://conferencecaptioning.com/) provides realtime captions and translations for your live events, to enable accessibility & inclusion within seconds. We work completely on-device, keeping costs low while performing better than anything else out there in terms of accuracy and speed

This module will allow you to use the local apis to control your [ConferenceCaptioning app](https://conferencecaptioning.com/app)
by a device connected to the same router. You can start and stop captions & live translations, set the
language, control visibility and more!

To get started under a minute, [create a customized stream](https://app.conferencecaptioning.com) in the
ConferenceCaptioning customer portal and activate your account in the [Conference Captioning app](https://conferencecaptioning.com/app) on your device as shown in [this video](https://vimeo.com/1064921264). Then, in Companion, add this module under Connections, and in the connection configuration
paste the stream name and localhost of your captioning device (iOS, iPad or Mac).
