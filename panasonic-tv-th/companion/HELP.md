## Panasonic TV TH-Series

This module will connect to a Panasonic TV TH series, such as the TH-86CQ1W, TH-75CQ1W, TH-65CQ1W, TH-55CQ1W, TH-50CQ1, TH-43CQ1W and TH-49CQE1W models.

On older displays, make sure you are using "Protocol 1" in the Display Settings instead of "Protocol 2" ("Protocol 2" is actually PJLink, and you can use the PJLink module instead of this module.)

Older displays may not support authentication correctly, so if you are having issues, disable protect mode/authentication on the display.

**Available Commands**

- Power On
- Power Off
- Set Volume
- Mute
- Input Select
- View Mode

**Available Feedbacks**

New models (such as the TH-49CQE1W), require an updated communication protocol, if using one of these new models you will also get the power status reported as a variable.
