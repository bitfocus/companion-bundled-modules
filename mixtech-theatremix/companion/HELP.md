## TheatreMix

TheatreMix helps you mix sound for theatre shows â€” without tedious console programming.

It creates and runs DCA cues: automating mundane snapshot management so you can focus on the mix. Additionally, it provides automatic channel level monitoring, seamless backup microphone switching, and playback software remote control from the console.

TheatreMix supports a wide range of digital mixing consoles used in many venues, and is suitable for shows of all sizes: including community, school, university, and commercial productions.
