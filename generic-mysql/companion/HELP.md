## MySQL and MariaDB

This module provides two major functions:
* Two actions to execute SQL statements. You can use Companion variables as part of the query, either via string replacement or via prepared statements.
* A feedback that can be used to store the results of an SQL query into a Companion variable. You can define the feedback as part of a button definition or in a trigger. If the feedback is part of a button definition, it will not impact the button's appearance, like other feedbacks might do. It only updates the variable.
