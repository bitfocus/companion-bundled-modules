## CaptionKit

[CaptionKit](https://captionkit.io/) provides realtime captions and translations for your church, to help
provide accessible services with multilingual and hard-of-hearing congregations.

This module will allow you to use [CaptionKit signals](https://docs.captionkit.io/en/articles/10172993-signals)
to remotely control your CaptionKit dashboard or app. You can use signals to start and stop captions, set the
language, control caption visibility and more.

To get started, [create an API key](https://docs.captionkit.io/en/articles/10172972-connect-to-the-api) in the
CaptionKit dashboard. Then, in Companion, add this module under Connections, and in the connection configuration
paste the API key.

There are CaptionKit presets provided for all signals, or you can use the "Send signal" and "Set transcription
language" actions as part of more complex buttons.
