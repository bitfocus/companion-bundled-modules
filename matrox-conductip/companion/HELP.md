# Matrox ConductIP

This module provides actions and presets to run Matrox ConductIP salvos.

This module will automatically fetch available rooms and panels every second. You can use presets to find the rooms and panels your user has access to. And you can use variables to keep labels on buttons up to date with the labels of the salvos inside ConductIP.

Usernames and passwords are the same as on the Conduct IP web interface. Make sure to assign at least one room and panel to a user for it to work with this module.
