# Matrox ConductIP

This module provides actions, feedbacks, and presets for the [Matrox ConductIP](https://video.matrox.com/en/products/infrastructure/convertip-series/conductip).

**Note: ConductIP software version 2.04.0 or higher is required to use versions ≥1.1.0 of this module**

# Getting Started

- Setup a user using the ConductIP's Web UI, and ensure it has permissions for at least one room you wish to control
- Enter the Username and Password into the module configuration
- If using a self-signed certificate, enable the "Allow Unverified/Self-Signed HTTPS Certificates" toggle

This module will automatically populate available rooms and panels, and keep them up to date. You can use presets to find the rooms and panels your user has access to. And you can use variables to keep labels on buttons up to date with the labels of the presets inside ConductIP.
