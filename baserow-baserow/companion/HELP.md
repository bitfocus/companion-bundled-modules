## Baserow

This module provides access to baserow tables.

### Connection parameters

You can define a list of tables in the connection parameters. For these tables, variables will be created,
reflecting the values of the table cells. If you don't want to use variables, you can leave the config
option empty. You will still be able to use actions and feedbacks.

### Actions

This module provides an action that updates a table cell. You can use filters to select the cell that shall be updated.

### Feedbacks

This module does not provide feedbacks. You can use the internal "Variable"-feedbacks.
