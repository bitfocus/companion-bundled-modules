Change the resolution of samples. Supported bit depths (to and from):
 - "8": 8-bit int (unsigned)
 - Anything between "9" and "53" (integers, signed)
 - "32f": 32-bit float
 - "64": 64-bit float

## Install
```
npm install bitdepth
```

## Use

### Node
```javascript
const bitDepth = require("bitdepth");
```

### ES module
import bitDepth from **./dist/bitdepth.js**:
```javascript
import bitDepth from './dist/bitdepth.js';
```

## Browser
Use the compiled file in the */dist* folder:
```html
<script src="./dist/bitdepth.min.js"></script>
```

Or get it from the [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bitdepth) CDN:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bitdepth"></script>
```

Or get it from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/bitdepth):
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bitdepth"></script>
```

Or as a ES6 module in modern browsers from [jspm](https://jspm.io):
```html
<script type="module">
  import bitDepth from 'https://dev.jspm.io/bitdepth';
  // ...
</script>
```

## API
```javascript
/**
 * Change the bit depth of samples. The input array.
 * @param {!TypedArray} input The samples.
 * @param {string} original The original bit depth of the data.
 *      One of "8" ... "53", "32f", "64"
 * @param {string} target The desired bit depth for the data.
 *      One of "8" ... "53", "32f", "64"
 * @param {!TypedArray} output The output array.
 */
function bitDepth(input, original, target, output) {}
```

## Distribution
This library is a ES module also distributed as a CommonJS module, UMD module and a compiled script for browsers. It works out of the box in Node when installed with ```npm install bitdepth```. It includes a TypeScript definition file.

If you use the [Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler), this package includes a externs file: **./externs.js**.

### If you are using this lib in a browser:

You may load both **./dist/bitdepth.umd.js** and **./dist/bitdepth.min.js** in the browser with ```<script>``` tags. Ideally you should use **bitdepth.min.js**. You can load it via the https://unpkg.com and https://www.jsdelivr.com/ CDNs:

[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/bitdepth):
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bitdepth"></script>
```

[jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bitdepth):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bitdepth"></script>
```

### If you are using this lib as a dependency:

- The **CommonJS** dist is **./dist/bitdepth.cjs.js**. It is the dist file used by Node. It is served in the "main" field of package.json and is the source you are running when you **npm install bitdepth**. It is not compiled or minified.

- The **UMD** module is **./dist/bitdepth.umd.js**. It is transpiled to ES5 and compatible with Node, AMD and browsers. It is served in the "browser" field of package.json.

- The **browser-only** dist is **./dist/bitdepth.min.js**. It is transpiled to ES5 and compiled. It is used in the "unpkg" and "jsdelivr" fields of package.json.

- The **ES6 dist** is **./dist/bitdepth.js**, served as "es2015" in package.json. It is not compiled/minified.

- **./index.js** is served as "module" in package.json. This should be the entry point for bundlers.

If your module bundler is using "browser" as the entry point **your dist should work the same** but will be a larger file.
