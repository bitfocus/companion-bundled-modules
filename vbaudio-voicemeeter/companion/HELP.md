This module, as with Companion, is free and open source, but if you'd like to support the continued development of this and my other modules (vMix, Google Sheets, Twitch, Discord, and more) tips will always be appreciated either on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/thedist) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thedist).


# v2.0.0
Version 2 of the Voicemeeter module for Companion has had a complete overhaul of how it integrates with Voicemeeter. There is no longer a need for a DLL hook, or a proxy, and instead the connection is made entirely over VBAN due to cooperation with the Voicemeeter developers to enable what we need in Voicemeeter version 3.1.1.3 (Potato), 2.1.1.3 (Banana), or 1.1.1.3 (Standard).

Please ensure that Voicemeeter is updated, and both VBAN and the ASCII VBAN Stream (call 'Command1' by default) are enabled.
