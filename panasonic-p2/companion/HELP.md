## Panasonic P2

Companion Module to control Panasonic Cameras supporting the P2 Protocol. Tested with the AG-CX350 and HC-X2, but according to Panasonics Documentation, which can be found [here](https://eww.pass.panasonic.co.jp/pro-av/support/content/guide/EN/top.html#P2), this should work with the following devices:
- HPX3100 / HPX600 / HPX5000
- PX270 / PX800 / PX380
- Varicam35 / VaricamHS / VaricamLT
- EVA1
- CX Series
- HC-X2 (not mentioned in the documentation, probably as it was released afterwards, but tested working)


### Camera Configuration

To connect to a Camera, it must be on the same network as companion and "IP Remote" has to be enabled.
Due to the way the P2 Protocol works, every camera must have a different Port to work with this Companion module.
