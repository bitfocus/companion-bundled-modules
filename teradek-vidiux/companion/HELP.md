Teradek VidiU X

## This module works specifically with the Teradek VidiU X model. It will not work with the original VidiU, and has not been tested on other models at this time.

## Actions

It is recommended to use the presets as much as possible as there are a lot of actions, variables, and feedbacks that work together.

The actions are separated into the following categories:

**Recording**

- Start/Stop

**Streaming**

_Depending on your streaming platform, you may need to determine which of these actions will control your stream. The default is Publish/Unpublish._

- Publish
- Unpublish
- Broadcast
- Halt
- Cancel
- Preview
- End Preview
- Complete
